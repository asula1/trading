# Auto-Trading System (MSA Architecture)

This project implements an automated cryptocurrency trading system with a Microservice Architecture (MSA) using Docker containers. The system collects real-time market data, makes trading decisions using AI predictions based on deep learning, and manages a cryptocurrency portfolio.

## Architecture Overview

The system is composed of the following microservices:

```
┌───────────────┐     ┌───────────────┐     ┌───────────────┐
│   Market Data │     │   Trading     │     │ AI Prediction │

- **Publish/Subscribe**: For broadcasting events to multiple interested services

### Communication Scenarios
1. **Market Data Flow**:
   - Market Data Service collects data from Upbit API
   - Data is published to Kafka `market-data` topic
   - Trading Service and AI Prediction Service consume the data
   - Dashboard receives updates via WebSocket

2. **Trading Execution Flow**:
   - Trading signals originate from AI Prediction Service
   - Trading Service validates and executes trades
   - Position Service updates position information
   - Trade events published to Kafka for analysis and monitoring
   - Risk Management Service validates compliance with limits

3. **User Interaction Flow**:
   - User requests arrive at API Gateway
   - Requests routed to appropriate service
   - Authentication handled by Account Service
   - Responses aggregated and returned to user
   - Events logged for audit and analysis

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- NVIDIA GPU (optional, for accelerated model training)
- NVIDIA Container Toolkit (for GPU support)

### Starting the System
```bash
./start.sh
```

### Accessing the Dashboard
Open a web browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8000
```

### Stopping the System
```bash
./stop.sh
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

#### API Authentication
- `UPBIT_ACCESS_KEY`: Your Upbit API access key (optional)
- `UPBIT_SECRET_KEY`: Your Upbit API secret key (optional)

If API keys are not provided, the system will run in simulation mode with mock data.

#### AI Service Configuration
- `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL`: TensorFlow logging level (default: 2)
- `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`: Specify which GPUs to use (default: 0)
- `TF_FORCE_GPU_ALLOW_GROWTH`: Enable dynamic GPU memory allocation (default: true)

The AI Prediction Service automatically detects GPU availability and uses it for model training if available. CPU fallback is automatic if no GPU is detected.

#### Database Configuration
- `POSTGRES_USER`: Database username (default: postgres)
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: Database password (default: postgres)
- `POSTGRES_DB`: Database name (default: trading)

#### Kafka Configuration
- `KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS`: Kafka listener configuration
- `KAFKA_AUTO_CREATE_TOPICS_ENABLE`: Enable auto topic creation (default: true)

#### Consul Configuration
- `CONSUL_BIND_INTERFACE`: Network interface for Consul (default: eth0)
- `CONSUL_CLIENT_INTERFACE`: Client interface for Consul (default: eth0)

### Authentication
The system uses JWT authentication to securely communicate with the Upbit API. This requires:
1. Proper JWT token generation with HS512 algorithm (required by Upbit API)
2. Token signature using the Upbit secret key
3. Authorization headers with Bearer token format

This authentication allows secure access to account information and trading functions. Both market data and trading services implement consistent authentication methods using PyJWT.

## Monitoring

## Adapting from Original Code

This MSA implementation adapts code from the original monolithic structure:
- `services/data_collection/upbit_api.py` → `services/market-data/main.py`
- `services/data_collection/data_collector.py` → `services/market-data/main.py`
- `services/trading/trader.py` → `services/trading/main.py`
- `services/ai_prediction/model.py` → `services/ai-prediction/main.py`

The services maintain the same core functionality while enabling independent scalability and deployment. Additional services have been added to enhance functionality and resilience.

## Service Persistence and State Management

### Account Persistence on Service Restart
When the trading service restarts, it automatically preserves your portfolio using the following process:

1. **Real Account Mode** (When API keys are provided):
   - Connects to Upbit API and fetches current account information
   - Retrieves all currency balances and positions
   - Loads all existing coin holdings with their average purchase prices
   - Maintains all open positions without interruption
   - Calculates current profit/loss based on latest market prices
   - No trades are automatically closed or opened during restart
   - Position history preserved for analytics
   - Trading state recovered from persistent storage

2. **Simulation Mode** (Without API keys):
   - No persistence between restarts
   - Initializes with default mock account (1,000,000 KRW)
   - No coin holdings are preserved in simulation mode
   - Option to save simulation state to database
   - Ability to restore from saved simulation checkpoint
   - Historical simulation data available for analysis

### AI Model Persistence
- Models and training data are not persisted between service restarts
- Initial training is performed on startup with fresh data
- New trading signals are generated after service restart
- Existing trading positions are preserved but evaluated with new signals
- Model checkpoints saved during training
- Model versioning and comparison capabilities
- Performance metrics tracked across restarts
- Model parameter history maintained
- Option to load pre-trained models

### Trading Decision Handling
When restarting services:
1. Trading Service continues to manage existing positions
2. AI Prediction Service generates new predictions based on fresh data
3. Existing positions are evaluated using the new prediction model
4. No automatic closing of positions based only on service restart
5. Risk limits and controls remain in effect
6. Position service maintains current position state
7. Strategy parameters preserved across restarts
8. Trading history available for context
